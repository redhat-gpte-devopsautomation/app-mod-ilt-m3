A common way of speaking about migrating or modernizing workloads to the cloud has been coined as `the 6 Rs framework`. This framework can be broken down as follows.

image::mod-strategies-refactor.png[Modernization Strategies]

`Refactor` to Microservices with `High Benefits` as below:

* Iteratively strangle services into individual observable microservices running in separate containers.
* More productive developers via fast inner loop development. Faster startup time using link:https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[cloud-native runtimes^] (e.g. link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-quarkus[Quarkus^], link:https://access.redhat.com/products/spring-boot[Spring Boot^])
* Isolated domains allow for faster iteration, recovery of services, efficient scalability, and ability to experiment more quickly.
* Basis to begin integrating with application services for greater innovation and reach at lower costs

This module will walk you through 2 of the phases (_Refactor_, _Deployment_) as follows:

* Refactor the legacy application (*Customers*) to fix the legacy configuration issue in the Tackle Analysis report
* Deploy the modernized applications to OpenShift using link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/cicd/index#builds-binary-source_creating-build-inputs[OpenShift Binary Build and Deployment^]

== 1.1. Understand the Globex Retail System Architecture

The Globex system (workshop environment) consists of microservices applications that are deployed across multiple platforms such as virtual machines and a container platform as depicted below.

image::architecture_initial_m2.png[architecture_initial_m2]

Your initial state for this workshop is an environment that is spread over Red Hat Virtualization and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Your application has already been partially moved from your legacy environments to OpenShift.

The Globex retail system is multiple services consisting of a _Node.js_ frontend service which is getting its data via a gateway service. The gateway service is connected to three backend services such as customers, orders and inventory. Each service uses its own database to store data.

The services running on OpenShift are deployed in a namespace `retail-%USERID%`. The services will ultimately be managed using the *OpenShift GitOps* and *Pipelines* covered in module 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will focus on refactoring the legacy application in the above red box section and deploy it to the OpenShift cluster using a binary build strategy today.
====

[NOTE]
====
You might see the customers pods are failed to run due to _ImagePullBackOff Error_. It will be fixed when you in the OpenShift CI/CD and GitOps (module 3) section.
====

All source code for the applications as well as the GitOps YAML manifests for all services are stored in a (GitHub compatible) *Gitea* repository that for workshop purposes is hosted on the OpenShift cluster.

The first issues is the *customers* service:

* The customers service uses an old Java code base running on `Apache Tomcat` in a VM on `Red Hat Virtualization`. In this module you will refactor the legacy Java code and then deploy the application to OpenShift on top of Red Hat JBoss Web Server.
* The customers database is using an `Oracle database` running as a VM in Red Hat Virtualization. Because this is Oracle you can not deploy the database as a Pod on OpenShift - therefore the Globex's SRE team will migrate a new virtual machine based on `OpenShift Virtualization` migrated by the `OpenShift Migration Toolkit for Virtualization`.

When you have finished the all modules in Dev track, your TO-BE deployment architecture should look like this:

== 1.2. Workshop Environment

=== 1.2.1. Confirm Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[alreadyset]

If your `username` is properly set, then you can move on. *If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned* like this:

image::setuser.png[setuser]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidentally type the wrong username, just update your username in the URL parameters (e.g. _1-introduction.html?USERID=%USERID%_)

[IMPORTANT]
====
You have to use *an unique username* (e.g. `%USERID%`) while you're running the hands-on labs. For example, you need to deploy applications to your own project (e.g. retail-%USERID%).
====

=== 1.2.2. OpenShift Cluster

Your OpenShift cluster is already configured with everything you need. Here are the details:

* `Gitea` to host the source code repositories)
* `OpenShift Virtualization` to ultimately run the migrated Oracle VM)
* `Migration Toolkit for Virtualization` to facilitate the migration of the Oracle VM from Red Hat Virtualization to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform)
* `OpenShift GitOps` to manage the deployed services using a GitOps approach through ArgoCD
* `OpenShift Pipelines` to build the customer application from source code and deploy to the `retail` project using GitOps
* `Migration Toolkit for Applications (Tackle)` to help modernize the customer service Java source code.

=== 1.2.3. Visual Studio Code Server

Visual Studio (VS) Code Servers are already deployed in the OpenShift cluster to facilitate an easy demonstration environment. This means you don't need to install and configure VS Code on your local environment but you can just use the one provided in a web browser.

This makes it easy to change any source code and configuration files in the cloned repository.

To get started, access the link:https://codeserver-codeserver-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[VS Code server instance^] and log in using the following `password`.

* Password: `{openshift-password}`

image::vscode-server-login.png[vscode-server-login]

The graphical user interface (GUI) should look like:

image::vscode.png[VSCode]

== 1.3. Explore the Globex Retail Services (GUI)

You can check what the `Globex retail service` looks like currently by accessing the frontend web application. To find the URL to access the *Frontend* application, you need to use the OpenShift command line tool (`oc`). Go to the VS Code server and Open a new terminal that already installed the _oc_ command by default. 

Click on `New Terminal` in Terminal menu in the VS Code. Once a new terminal is open, run the following _oc_ command.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc login -u %USERID% -p openshift https://openshift.default.svc:443
----

image::vscode-terminal.png[vscode-terminal]

[NOTE]
====
When you see a popup message, *"See text and images copied to the clipboard"*, click on `Allow`. Then you might also see `"Use insecure connections?"` message in the terminal. In case, press `y`.
====

Find the `Route` URL for the *Frontend* application. Run the following `oc` command in the VS Code server terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get route ordersfrontend -n retail-%USERID%
----

The output should look like:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
NAME             HOST/PORT                                                                PATH   SERVICES         PORT   TERMINATION     WILDCARD
ordersfrontend   ordersfrontend-retail-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%          ordersfrontend   web    edge/Redirect   None
----

Navigate to the orders frontend route. You can use either _https_ or _http_ (which will be redirected to _https_).

image::frontend.png[Frontend]

Click through the three panels on the left.

* `Customers` shows the list of the customer information such as _fullname, city, country, and username_.
* `Orders` shows current order information including relevant customer data.
* `Products` shows the current inventory information.

== 1.4. Access the Customer Data

The RHV environment not only has the Oracle Database VM deployed but it also hosts another VM which runs the old customer application on top of Apache Tomcat.

From a terminal window you can use `curl` to demonstrate that the application is connected to the database.

Use the IP Address of the *Customer Service (Tomcat VM)* to access the customer service. You can run the following _curl_ command in the VS Code server's terminal or your local environment since the Tomcat IP address is publicly accessible. 

Run the following `curl` commands in the VS Code server terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl http://%TOMCATIP%:8080/customers-tomcat-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/customers/1 ; echo
----

The output should look like:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
{"id":1,"username":"phlegm_master_19","name":"Guybrush","surname":"Threepwood","address":"1060 West Addison","zipCode":"ME-001","city":"Melee Town","country":"Melee Island"}
----

Try to get another customer data.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl http://%TOMCATIP%:8080/customers-tomcat-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/customers/2 ; echo
----

The output should look like:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
{"id":2,"username":"hate_guybrush","name":"Pirate","surname":"Lechuck","address":"Caverns of Meat, no number","zipCode":"MO-666","city":"Giant Monkey Head","country":"Monkey Island"}
